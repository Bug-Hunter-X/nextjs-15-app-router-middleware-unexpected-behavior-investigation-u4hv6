# Next.js 15 App Router Middleware Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using custom middleware functions within the Next.js 15 App Router.  The issue involves modifications to response headers not being consistently applied.

## Bug Description

A custom middleware function is intended to modify response headers (e.g., adding custom security headers). However, under certain conditions (which need further investigation), these header modifications are not reflected in the final response. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the response headers in your browser's developer tools.  You might find the expected headers missing or overwritten.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware function should successfully modify the response headers as defined within the function's logic.

## Actual Behavior

The response headers are either not modified or are overridden unexpectedly. This inconsistency makes it difficult to reliably implement custom header modifications in the middleware.

## Solution
The solution involves further investigation into the middleware's execution flow, the order of header modifications, and potential conflicts with other aspects of the Next.js 15 App Router.
